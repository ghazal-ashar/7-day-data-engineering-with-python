## 📊 What You’ll Learn
- How to build a **mini ETL pipeline** in Pandas from raw to production-ready data  
- How to enforce **schemas & quality checks** in real datasets  
- How to **partition, aggregate, and transform** data for downstream use  
- How to use **visualization as validation** in pipeline QA  
- How to simulate a **real Data Engineering lifecycle** (Ingest → Clean → Transform → Validate → Store)
